# ATM
## This repository includes starter files for a Refactoring the ATM activity done through MIT's coding program as well as files that make improvements to the starter code. Improvements include adding a drop down selection for depositing or withdrawing cash, a submit button, a current account balance, and an element that prevents more cash being taken out than is currently available.
